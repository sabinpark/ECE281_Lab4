===========

Sabin's Lab 4

### Overview
  1.  Create PRISM's ALU to execute math and logic operations
  2.  Create PRISM's datapath using the ALU
  3.  Simulate the datapath and understand its operation


### Provided Files
  * ALU_shell.vhd
  * ALU_testbench.vhd
  * Datapath_shell.vhd
  * Datapath_testbench.vhd
  * Lab4_waveform.wcfg

## ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
After downloading the appropriate files, my first task was to write code inside the ALU_shell to implement the ALU functionality.  

### ALU Functionality
| OpSel  | Function 
|:------:|:---------
| 0 | AND
| 1 | NEG
| 2 | NOT

## Datapath
