## ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
After downloading the appropriate files, my first task was to write code inside the ALU_shell to implement the ALU functionality.  

### ALU Functionality
| OpSel  | Function 
|:------:|:---------
| 0 | AND
| 1 | NEG
| 2 | NOT
| 3 | ROR
| 4 | OR
| 5 | IN 
| 6 | ADD
| 7 | LDA


Under *ARCHITECTURE*, I created a std_logic_vector called *temp_Result*, which was used to store the value of what *Result* would ultimately be.  I proceeded to use the case statement method of creating the MUX.  Because *OpSel* determined which function the ALU accomplish, it was easy to see that *OpSel* would also act as the case.  Writing the actual code for the different functions was not all too difficult--all but one of the functionality took only one line of code.

The only trouble I had was in ROR.  I first attempted to create an intermediary signal which would store the "shifted" values of the *Accumulator*, then send in the intermediary signal to *temp_Result*.  However, when I simulated the design, I had errors in that the values I should have gotten were all shifted to the right.  This error occurred because the intermediary signal acted as a latch and took in the previous value of the intermediary signal.  I then changed my approach to the problem by directly assigning *temp_Result* to the appropriate values from *Accumulator*.  This fixed the problem and ROR worked as expected.

*UPDATE:* I found another way to do the ROR functionality using the built-in functionality within ISE.
```vhdl
    temp_Result <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(Accumulator) ror 1);
```

After checking my syntax and making sure nothing was wrong with the code, I proceeded to simulate the ALU using the provided testbench.

### ALU Simulation

The simulation ran successfully, displaying a beautiful wave of green results.  I went through each of the *OpSel* values with their corresponding values for *Accumulator* and *Data*.  I am happy to say that all of the values were correct.  Most of the funcionality is quite self-explanatory--they did what they were supposed to.  And so I find it unnecessary to go into depth for each part.
